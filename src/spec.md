## Summary
**Goal:** Enable the application to sign, post, and broadcast mainnet Bitcoin transactions to Segwit wallets with automatic fee coverage from reserves.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement cryptographic signing of mainnet Bitcoin wallet transfers with secure key management
- Add AI-powered transaction posting to blockchain network with automatic confirmation monitoring
- Support sending mainnet transactions to Segwit Bitcoin wallet addresses with automatic fee estimation
- Use reserve balance to cover transaction fees automatically
- Broadcast transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain network
- Update frontend to display transaction signing, posting, and confirmation states

**User-visible outcome:** Users can initiate Bitcoin transfers that are automatically signed by the application, posted to the mainnet blockchain, and broadcast to Segwit wallet addresses with fees covered by reserves. The UI shows real-time transaction status including signing, posting, and confirmation progress.
