  "summary": "All three requirements are fully implemented. The diff shows comprehensive backend validation in main.mo with exact 64-character hex transaction ID validation and 8 decimal place BTC amount validation. Both frontend forms (ManualVerificationForm and InstantFundingForm) implement frontend validation, backend error display, and success feedback. The useRecordBitcoinPurchase mutation includes balance cache invalidation for immediate UI updates. Error formatting is centralized in errors.ts with specific handling for backend validation messages.",
