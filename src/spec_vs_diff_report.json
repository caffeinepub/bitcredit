The diff shows modifications that appear to add/expand multiple unrelated backend and frontend capabilities (credit purchase via blockchain verification, send BTC transfer system, transaction history UI, profile/onboarding, theme work, admin loading/credentials flows), which goes beyond the requested admin credit distribution page.",
