  "summary": "The diff clearly adds frontend UI affordances for re-checking on-chain status and copying/displaying a txid in the transfer details dialog, and introduces new helper utilities and admin-related diagnostics that are not part of the stated requirements. Due to backend/main.mo being truncated, the core backend requirements (broadcast-on-create, failure rollback semantics, and a confirm-on-chain backend method) cannot be conclusively verified from the provided diff summary.",
