  "summary": "The diff provides only truncated views of backend/main.mo and project_state.json. The truncated backend/main.mo snippet shows type definitions and data structures for the sendBTC flow (SendBTCRequest, TransferStatus, etc.) but does not include the actual sendBTC method implementation where user registration validation would be removed. Without visibility into the sendBTC method code or error handling logic, it is impossible to verify whether REQ-202 (removal of user registration checks) or REQ-203 (updated error handling to rely only on blockchain API validation) have been implemented.",
