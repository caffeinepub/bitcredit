  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo and project_state.json. The backend changes appear to remove address validation and user registration checks from the sendBTC flow, which aligns with REQ-190. However, the diff is severely truncated, making it impossible to verify the complete implementation of all three requirements, particularly the development logging (REQ-192) and admin principal recognition (REQ-191).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-192",
      "requirement": "Add development-only logging to the backend sendBTC flow that captures and surfaces (a) the destination address being processed, (b) any validation checks performed on the destination, (c) any checks for user account existence or registration status, and (d) the specific error/trap message when a transfer fails",
      "reason": "The truncated diff of backend/main.mo does not show any logging statements or Debug.print calls in the sendBTC flow. Without seeing the complete sendBTC implementation, there is no evidence that development logging for destination addresses, validation steps, account existence checks, or error details has been added.",
