  "summary": "The diff removes Bitcoin address format validation from both frontend forms (SendBtcPage.tsx, AdminPage.tsx) and backend (main.mo), passes addresses directly to the blockchain API, and implements enhanced error handling for blockchain API address rejections. The changes align closely with requirements REQ-186, REQ-187, REQ-188, and REQ-189. A migration module was added to handle the data model change removing addressValidation fields from SendBTCRequest records.",

    {
      "description": "Migration module (backend/migration.mo) was implemented to convert legacy SendBTCRequest records with addressValidation fields to new records without that field",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states 'Preserve all existing transfer request auditability and ledger accounting' as a constraint, but does not request or specify implementing a migration module to handle the schema change. While this is a reasonable implementation decision to preserve data during the schema change, it was not explicitly requested in the requirements.",
