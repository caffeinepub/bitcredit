  "summary": "The diff shows comprehensive implementation of profile creation functionality with error handling and validation. All three requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) appear to be addressed through changes to ProfileSetupModal.tsx, useQueries.ts hooks, and backend main.mo. The implementation includes validation, error handling, loading states, toast notifications, and proper data structure matching between frontend and backend.",

    {
      "description": "Migration module added in backend/migration.mo with complex Bitcoin-related state management including BTC price tracking, reserve balances, transaction fees, multisig configuration, and blockchain API configuration",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is specifically about fixing username persistence in profile creation with explicit constraints to maintain single-actor architecture and not modify authentication. A migration module with extensive Bitcoin financial infrastructure was not requested and appears unrelated to the profile username persistence issue.",
