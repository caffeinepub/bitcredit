  "summary": "The implementation successfully delivers all 8 requirements for manual Bitcoin transaction verification. Backend methods (submitVerificationRequest, approveVerificationRequest, rejectVerificationRequest) are implemented in backend/main.mo with proper status tracking and admin controls. Frontend includes user verification page at /verify-transaction with form and history table, admin verification requests page at /admin/verification-requests with approve/reject actions, navigation links in both user and admin sections, and all required React Query hooks in useQueries.ts. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
